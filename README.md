simple_shell project repository
===============================

This repository contains the files for ALX's **simple_shell**. It can be compiled using GCC and will execute a simple shell that can be used for some basic tasks and programs most commonly found in the /bin/ folder.

# Pre-requisites

### Authorized functions and macros:
- access (man 2 access)
- chdir (man 2 chdir)
- close (man 2 close)
- closedir (man 3 closedir)
- execve (man 2 execve)
- exit (man 3 exit)
- _exit (man 2 _exit)
- fflush (man 3 fflush)
- fork (man 2 fork)
- free (man 3 free)
- getcwd (man 3 getcwd)
- getline (man 3 getline)
- isatty (man 3 isatty)
- kill (man 2 kill)
- malloc (man 3 malloc)
- open (man 2 open)
- opendir (man 3 opendir)
- perror (man 3 perror)
- read (man 2 read)
- readdir (man 3 readdir)
- signal (man 2 signal)
- stat (__xstat) (man 2 stat)
- lstat (__lxstat) (man 2 lstat)
- fstat (__fxstat) (man 2 fstat)
- strtok (man 3 strtok)
- wait (man 2 wait)
- waitpid (man 2 waitpid)
- wait3 (man 2 wait3)
- wait4 (man 2 wait4)
- write (man 2 write)

### GCC command to compile:
`
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
`

This wil compile all the '.c' files and change the output's name to 'hsh'.

### Template to test output:
=============
$ ./hsh

($) 

hsh main.c shell.c

$ exit
$


After you clone this repository and compile the program with the command above, you will generate a file called **hsh** that can be executed by entering  ```./hsh``` in your shell.

The output after the program is executed should look something like this:
```
$|
```
Where you will get a prompt in the shape of a dollar sign so you can start typing commands into your shell.  Agood example of how it should execute is the command shown above were the user enters 'ls' and then gets a list of the directory contents.

### Parts of a Shell Program

The shell implementation is divided into three parts: ​

`The Parser`​
`The Executor`​
`Shell Subsystems`

## The Parser

The Parser is the software component that reads the command line such as “ls ­al” and puts it into a data structure called Command Table ​that will store the commands that will be executed.

## The Executor

The executor will take the command table generated by the parser and for every SimpleCommand in the array it will create a new process. It will also if necessary create pipes to communicate the output of one process to the input of the next one. Additionally, it will redirect the standard input, standard output, and standard error if there are any redirections.

## Shell Subsystems

`Enviroment Variables`: Expressions of the form${VAR} are expanded with the corresponding environment variable. Also the shell should be able to set, expand and print environment vars.

`Wildcards`: Arguments of the form a*a anre expanded to all the files that match them in the local directory and in multiple directories.

`Subshells`: Arguments between "" (backticks) are executed and the output is sent as input to the shell.
